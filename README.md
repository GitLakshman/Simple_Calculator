## Code Overview  
### HTML  
- Defines the structure of the calculator, including buttons for digits and operations and a display area.  

### CSS  
- Styles the calculator to ensure a clean and modern look.  
- Adds responsiveness to ensure usability across different devices.  

### JavaScript  
- Handles user interactions, processes arithmetic operations, and updates the display dynamically.  

## Limitations  
- **No Advanced Functions**: This calculator only supports basic arithmetic.  
- **Single-Step Operations**: It does not handle complex expressions with multiple operations.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Add support for advanced operations like square root, percentage, and exponentiation.  
- Implement a history feature to display previous calculations.  
- Improve UI/UX with animations and themes.
