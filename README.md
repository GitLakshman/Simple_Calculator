# Simple Calculator  

A basic calculator application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations in a user-friendly interface.  

## Features  
- **Basic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
- **Interactive Interface**: Buttons for digits and operators designed for easy interaction.  
- **Dynamic Display**: Real-time display of input and results.  
- **Error Handling**: Basic validation for invalid operations (e.g., division by zero).  

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML5**: For creating the structure of the calculator.  
- **CSS3**: For styling the interface and improving user experience.  
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the functionality and logic of the calculator.

## Code Overview  
### HTML  
- Defines the structure of the calculator, including buttons for digits and operations and a display area.  

### CSS  
- Styles the calculator to ensure a clean and modern look.  
- Adds responsiveness to ensure usability across different devices.  

### JavaScript  
- Handles user interactions, processes arithmetic operations, and updates the display dynamically.  

## Limitations  
- **No Advanced Functions**: This calculator only supports basic arithmetic.  
- **Single-Step Operations**: It does not handle complex expressions with multiple operations.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Add support for advanced operations like square root, percentage, and exponentiation.  
- Implement a history feature to display previous calculations.  
- Improve UI/UX with animations and themes.
